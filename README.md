At-Malloc(https://github.com/At-EC/At-Malloc)) is an open and user-friendly implementation of memory management allocation with minimal resource cost designed for various embedded controllers' supporting, as it's beginning it will be an important member of the At-EC family.

The goal of the system is to explore and try to provide a range of features and capabilities to support and simplify your embedded firmware implementation.

We hope the At-EC will be a popular community-based embedded controller's project in the future. If this project was useful to you, give it a ‚≠ê. It is very important for us to know it is useful to you and your attention will encourage us. 

Welcome PRs! If you are interested in contributing, Pls join us at [Discord](https://discord.gg/AxfF9aH58G). 

## Architecture
The memory management allocation with minimal resource cost occupy 4 bytes in the each allocated memory.
